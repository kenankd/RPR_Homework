# Arithmetic Equation Solver using Dijkstra's Algorithm

This project is a command-line tool written in Java using IntelliJ IDEA that solves and parses arithmetic equations using Dijkstra's Algorithm. The program allows users to input arithmetic expressions as strings, and it will evaluate and provide the results.

## Features

- Solve arithmetic equations: The program can handle basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division and the sqrt operation.
- Parentheses support: The solver respects the order of operations by correctly evaluating expressions within parentheses.
- Error handling: The program performs syntax checking and provides meaningful error messages for invalid input expressions.
